https://example.com/blog/laptop-vs-desktop,"Choosing between a laptop and desktop computer depends on your specific needs. Laptops offer portability and convenience, making them ideal for students or professionals who work from different locations. They're also space-efficient for small apartments. Desktops, on the other hand, typically provide better performance per dollar, easier upgradeability, and better cooling for intensive tasks like gaming or video editing. Many users opt for a powerful desktop at home and a lightweight laptop for on-the-go use. Gaming laptops bridge the gap but often at a premium price point."
